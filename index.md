## Examples of My Past Personal Projects

### Hack and Dash

Hack and Dash is an infinite scrolling mobile game i developed using Unity and C#. In this game, the player is constantly moving vertically as well as horizontally, but they can control what direction they move horizontally. This takes place along different styles of paths with the goal being how far the player can go without touching a wall. Hack and dash is currently available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZestyGames.hackAndDash).
